# EnRust

EnRust is a chess engine written in Rust.

The name comes from a fusion of the chess move en passant and the Rust programming language.

The goals of this project are:
- To learn and deepen my understanding of Rust.
- To improve my problem-solving and algorithmic skills.
- To eventually build a competitive chess engine.
- To share the journey in blog posts, so others can learn from the process.

## Project Status

This project is in its very early stages. The first milestone is to implement the UCI protocol,
so the engine can communicate with chess GUIs like Cutechess or Arena.

## Development

EnRust is developed with:
- Rust (stable toolchain)
- Cargo for build and dependency management

Build and run:
``` bash
cargo build
cargo run
```
