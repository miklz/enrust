//! # Piece Definitions Module
//!
//! This module defines the core chess piece types, colors, and related
//! utility methods used throughout the engine.
//!
//! It provides:
//! - The [`PieceType`] enum, representing the abstract kind of a piece (king,
//!   queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawn).
//! - The [`Color`] enum, representing the side to which a piece belongs
//!   (white or black), including helper methods like [`Color::opposite`].
//! - The [`Piece`] enum, representing the concrete pieces (e.g. `WhitePawn`,
//!   `BlackQueen`) plus sentinel and empty squares, with methods for
//!   color/type queries, printing symbols, and checking relationships
//!   (friend, opponent, empty, sentinel).
//!
//! In short, this module is the foundation for representing pieces on the
//! board and is used by move generation, evaluation, and other parts of the
//! chess engine.

/// Represents the type of a chess piece, without its color.
///
/// Used to differentiate between different movement patterns
/// (e.g., `PieceType::Rook` vs `PieceType::Bishop`).
